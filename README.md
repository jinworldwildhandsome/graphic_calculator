This is the site for drawing various simple graph in different colors and scales. 

No libraries used.

# Features 

* you can select thickness of line 
* you can swich various colors 
* you can choose scale
* simple and clear to use
* cute page
* you can see all your previous graphs 
* you can delete useless 


# Usage 
Everyone knows how to use calculators for drawing graphs. In my variant of such usefull thing you just choose type of necessary function and input coefficients. Then all 
data appears on page. Also you can reestablish previous graph, change colors and thickness. 

At the start of  work you can see these page. You tend to tap the select and select function type. 
Then the algorithm is still the same simple, obvious and convenient. Bellow you can see full usage.
